When writing programs, I focus on making them clean, easy to read, and adaptable for future updates. In Project One, I worked on geolocation, setting up functionality to handle location data effectively, and in Project Two, I expanded on that by creating charts and filtering options for the dashboard. This approach made it easier to connect the geolocation data with visual elements, keeping the project organized and user-friendly. Solving problems starts with understanding the requirements, like Grazioso Salvareâ€™s need for location-based filtering and data visualization. I planned out how the data would flow between the database and the dashboard, ensuring the charts displayed accurate information and filtering worked seamlessly. Compared to other assignments, this project felt more practical and client-focused, teaching me how to align technical solutions with real-world needs. As a computer scientist, I create tools that solve problems and improve workflows, and projects like this help companies like Grazioso Salvare make better, faster decisions using their data.
